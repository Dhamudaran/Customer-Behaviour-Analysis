# Customer-Behaviour-Analysis
Customer  Behaviour Analysis using  Sql &amp; python   
📌 Customer Behaviour Analysis
Analyzing customer journey, engagement, and retention trends using SQL & Python

📖 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior using SQL & Python. It covers:
✔️ Customer journey tracking (drop-off points, conversion trends)
✔️ Engagement analysis (likes, views, clicks)
✔️ Sentiment analysis on customer reviews
✔️ Retention rate calculation
✔️ Best-performing products per region

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NLTK for sentiment analysis)

SQL (MySQL queries for data extraction & analysis)

Jupyter Notebook (for visualization & reporting)

📊 Features & Analysis
✅ 1. Customer Drop-Off Analysis
Identify key points where users abandon their journey (Homepage, Product Page, Checkout).

Optimize user experience to improve conversions.

✅ 2. Engagement Metrics
Track likes, views, and clicks across different content types.

Query:

SELECT ContentType, SUM(likes) AS TotalLikes, 
       SUM(CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(ViewsClicksCombined, '-', 1) AS UNSIGNED)) AS TotalViews, 
       SUM(CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(ViewsClicksCombined, '-', -1) AS UNSIGNED)) AS TotalClicks
FROM mm.guvi_engagement_data
GROUP BY ContentType;
✅ 3. Customer Retention Rate
Measure the percentage of repeat customers.

Query:


SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN customerType = 'Repeat' THEN CustomerID END) * 100.0 
        / COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID)) AS RetentionRate
FROM mm.guvi_customers;
✅ 4. Sentiment Analysis on Reviews
Identify positive, negative, and neutral sentiments in customer feedback.

Python NLP Approach (VADER):

python

from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
df['Sentiment'] = df['ReviewText'].apply(lambda x: 'Positive' if analyzer.polarity_scores(x)['compound'] > 0 else 'Negative')

📌 Future Enhancements
🔹 AI-based Predictive Customer Retention Model
🔹 Automated Customer Engagement Score Calculation
🔹 Real-time Sentiment Tracking using AI Models
