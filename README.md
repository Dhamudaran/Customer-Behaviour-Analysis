📊 Customer Behavior Analysis
Data-driven insights into customer engagement, retention, and marketing effectiveness

📖 Overview
ShopEasy, an online retail business, is facing declining customer engagement and conversion rates despite high marketing expenditures. This project aims to analyze customer journey patterns, reviews, and marketing performance using SQL and Python to provide data-driven business insights.

🚀 Business Objectives
✔️ Identify customer drop-off points in the purchase journey.
✔️ Analyze sentiment in customer reviews to understand satisfaction.
✔️ Measure marketing effectiveness through retention and engagement rates.
✔️ Optimize product recommendations based on buying patterns.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: pandas, MySQL-connector, NLTK

SQL: MySQL queries for data extraction & analysis

Jupyter Notebook/Spyder: Data visualization and reporting

📊 Features & Analysis
✅ 1. Customer Drop-Off Analysis
Identify key points where users abandon their journey (Homepage, Product Page, Checkout).

Optimize user experience to improve conversions.

✅ 2. Engagement Metrics
Track likes, views, and clicks across different content types.

Query:

SELECT ContentType, SUM(likes) AS TotalLikes, 
       SUM(CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(ViewsClicksCombined, '-', 1) AS UNSIGNED)) AS TotalViews, 
       SUM(CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(ViewsClicksCombined, '-', -1) AS UNSIGNED)) AS TotalClicks
FROM mm.guvi_engagement_data
GROUP BY ContentType;
✅ 3. Customer Retention Rate
Measure the percentage of repeat customers.

Query:


SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN customerType = 'Repeat' THEN CustomerID END) * 100.0 
        / COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID)) AS RetentionRate
FROM mm.guvi_customers;
✅ 4. Sentiment Analysis on Reviews
Identify positive, negative, and neutral sentiments in customer feedback.

Python NLP Approach (VADER):

python

from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
df['Sentiment'] = df['ReviewText'].apply(lambda x: 'Positive' if analyzer.polarity_scores(x)['compound'] > 0 else 'Negative')


📏 Evaluation Metrics
✔️ Customer drop-off reduction rate
✔️ Increase in repeat purchases
